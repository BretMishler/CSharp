THE NULL OBJECT PATTERN
	A software design pattern that uses object-orientation to remove
	or reduce the amoutn of null references and thus reduce the burden
	of repetitive null checking and handling code in specific parts
	of the codebase.

	Pros:
		Happier end users
			-reduce instances of null runtime errors
		Happier developers
			-reduce time writing repetitive null checking code
			-simplify test code
			-fewer branches in program control flow
			-reduce maintenance overheads: "do nothing" code exists in one centralized place

	Client Code can treat null objects and "real" objects the same way

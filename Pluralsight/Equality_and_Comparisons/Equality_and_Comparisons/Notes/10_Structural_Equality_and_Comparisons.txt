SUMMARY:
    Structural equality: Contains same elements in same order.
        -(Only supported by a few collections)

    IStructuralEquatable to check for structural equality.
        -Requires a custom equality comparer.

    IStructuralComparable to check for structural > or <.
        -Requires a customer comparer.

CONTENTS:
    Way of checking if collections contain:
        -The same elements.
        -In the same order.

    IStructuralEquatable

    IStructuralComparable

    Limited support:
        -Arrays
        -Tuples

    Course overview

STRUCTUAL EQUALITY AND IStructuralEquatable

    Supported by:
        -Arrays
        -Tuples

    Structual equality:
        Contains the same elements, in the same order
        as another collection

    !Arrays are ref types- dont implement equality

    IStructuralEquatable:
        allows testing for structual equality

    Although this looks useful, theres not that many
        collections that will support this

    IStructuralEquatable is not a generic interface

IStructuralComparable
    Like IstructuralEquatable

    But for ordering comparisons

    Tells you whether one structure comes before or after

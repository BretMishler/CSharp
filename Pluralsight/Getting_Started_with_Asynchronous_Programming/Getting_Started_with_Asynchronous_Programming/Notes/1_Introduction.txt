Example Application:
    Show a loading Indicator
    Start async operation of
        1. read a largte CSV file from disk
        2. Process rows in parallel
        3. Async operation completed
    Render result on screen
    Remove loading indicator
    
Synchronous Programming
    simultaneous processing
    handle result when processing is done

Asynchronous vs Parallel Programming
    Parallel programming is generally used to conquer a bigger problem
    and chop into smaller chunks

    can introduce parallel programming WITH asynchronous programming

    Imagine Boiling Eggs:
        Eggs boiling - boiling in "parallel"
        While eggs boil, you go do something else - asynchronously


Async Operation
    will notify us when operation is done!

AJAX:
    Asynchronous JavaScript and XML


Why do all this?
    Avoid unrelaible apps
    get happier users
    build faster apps

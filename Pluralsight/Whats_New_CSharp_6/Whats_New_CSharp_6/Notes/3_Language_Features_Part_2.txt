			var name = "no name";

            if(action != null && action.Method != null)
            {
                name = action.Method.Name;
            }

        introducted in C# 6, this is almost equalivalent to the above
            var name = action?.Method?.Name;

		If action is null, it returns nulls
		If action is not null but method is null, it will return null
		If action is not null and method is not null, it will return Name

		To make it totally equavilent
			var name = action?.Method?.Name ?? "no name";
